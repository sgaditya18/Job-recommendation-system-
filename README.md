# Job-recommendation-system-

In this project, I try to build a recommendation model to fetch jobs for a given Job Title. This is used widely across platforms like LinkedIn, Glassdoor and others. Firstly, the data is cleansed to have it ready for the model by repalcing nulls with the most frequently occuring value(mode). Using word cloud, depicted commonly occuring valus in the Job title, Key skills and Funcitonal Area column. Then, using Cosine similarity algorithm to create a similarity matrix for the Key Skills column. 
This gave me a good exposure to the cosine similarity algorithm and also the usage of word cloud chart in Python
